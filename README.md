# RUTGERS - Bike Travel Details



## Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using Python and Pandas functions, I was able to to convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get time in hours, minutes, and seconds. I was able to save the updated file within the reousrces folder to use for future assignments.

## Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

I was able to create a few differnt graphs:

1) The first graph listed below shows data for all users. This graph shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.

2) The second graph listed below shows data split up by genders. This graph shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.

3) The third graph listed below shows the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap.

4) The fourth grpah listed below shows the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap.

5) The final graph lsited below is a heatmap that shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype.

## Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By reviewing graph number 4, you can view that both genders start-time are either morning based (7 A.M.- 9 A.M.) or are afternoon based (5 P.M. - 7 P.M). If you want to view it by genders, you can view that the Males contains a higher percentage compared to females. If you review graph number 5, you can see that that the males who are subscriber dominates the entire graph. This alone will show investors that a high number of Males subscribers are currently active.
